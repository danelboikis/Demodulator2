This is a project created to demonstrate an old time dial-up modem.
This part (demodulator) is the second out of two. The first part can be found at: https://github.com/danelboikis/Demodulator2.git .
This part is the demodulator. You can configure the message along with other configurations by editing the file "Demodulator.java". Make sure to change the configurations of the first part accordingly as it is installed on a different device.
The data is received from the first part of the project (demodulator) by sound, using the FSK modulation scheme. I used FFT to analyze the received data and display it to the user.
